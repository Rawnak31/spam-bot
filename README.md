# spam-bot
This spam-bot is mainly intended for spamming messages in a chat. Although, it can be used anywhere as it works depending on where the mouse is clicked (as it uses pyautogui), it is better suited for text channels or chats.
It is not based on an app or a server so to use it the person has to copy the code and run it in their IDE.
I mainly created this to annoy my friends and that's all.
